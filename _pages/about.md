<p>
Machine Learning Scientist with an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Alberta, specializing in
building and deploying LLM-based systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic AI, and
memory-augmented architectures.
</p>

<p>
Proven research experience in post-training alignment, inference-time scaling, and reasoning, with additional
background in reinforcement learning and computer vision. Published at
ICLR 2026, COLING 2025, and SemEval 2024.
</p>

<p>
Strong focus on making LLMs faster and more resource-efficient using quantization, FlashAttention, pruning,
knowledge distillation, weight sharing, mixed-precision inference, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
Industry experience as a Software Engineer and Backend Developer, building scalable production systems using
distributed architectures, search and retrieval infrastructure, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.
